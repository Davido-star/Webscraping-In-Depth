# Webscraping-In-Depth
This python script pulls an image from a wikipedia page and downloads it to your computer 
Description: This script web-scrapes data from a wikipedia website to extract an image and download it to your local disk.  
Inputs: Wikipedia website and image tags.  
Outputs: .jeg file.  

I difficultly viewing the image when it first downloaded, my system said it didnt reconize the file type. I spoke to Shashank in office hours and we figured out my system wasnt able to read the image but the image was fine. I tried the code from co-lab on a different system and the image oppened fine.
